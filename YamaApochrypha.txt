Riyujin Jakka - All Things in the Universe, Turn to Ashes: C(A)
In its sealed form, Riyujin Jakka is a plain  katana with a purple cloth handle. It's slashes directly affect the souls of its enemines and purifies corrupted spirits. The sword is nurtured from an asauchi, a blade that is created by the Sword God Oh-Etsu Nimaya through unknown means. Due to Oh-Etsu's status as a member of Squad Zero and he himself being an Oken, his creations are imbued with a small portion of divinity. This blade cannot be Traced or copied. If used by others who are not its true user, it will be greatly weakened.
When Ruler unleashes his shikai, the rank of Riyujin Jakka jumps to A. In this form, an endless torrent of flames are generated from it.
Zanka no Tachi - Blade of Embers: A+
